# SuperMarket Sales Analysis and Forecasting

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook analyzing sales data from a supermarket chain and building a demand forecasting model. The notebook includes:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations of daily, weekly and monthly sales trends
- Time series decomposition 
- Demand forecasting using LSTM neural networks
- Model evaluation and future predictions

The analysis provides insights into sales patterns and demonstrates how to build a deep learning model for forecasting future demand. Useful for data scientists and analysts working with retail sales data.

The Supermarket Dataset that was used was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faresashraf1001/supermarket-sales
